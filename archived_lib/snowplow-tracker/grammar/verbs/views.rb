    # Converts this Verb into a Hash representing its

    # Follows the Snowplow Tracker Protocol:

    # Returns a VerbHash

    #
    # WARNING: all the Web's tiers of caching mean
    # that relying on your web server to track
    # page views is almost always a BAD IDEA.
    #
    # Use the Snowplow JavaScript Tracker instead:

    # Parameters:
    # +web_page+:: the WebPage the user is viewing
    # +modifiers+:: a Hash of modifiers. Can include custom Context
    #               and specific Collectors to send this event to
    #
    # Returns an Array containing a single complete Payload
