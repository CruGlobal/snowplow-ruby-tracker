module Snowplow

  # Check we have a valid Context Hash.
  #
  # Must contain:
  # 1. platform ("p")
  # 2. time ("dtm")
  #
  # All other elements are optional
  ContextHash = ({ :p => String, :dtm => String })

  # Stores the Context which encapsulates an individual
  # Snowplow event.
  # We let Context be much more mutable than our Entities,
  # because this fits the real-world better: context
  # slowly mutates as events happen.
