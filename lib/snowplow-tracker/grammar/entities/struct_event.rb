    # Constructor for a new custom structured event

    #              objects you want to track
    # +action+:: a string that is uniquely paired with each
    #            category, and commonly used to define the
    #            type of user interaction for the object
    # +label+:: an optional string to provide additional
    #           dimensions to the event data
    # +property+:: an optional string describing the object
    #              or the action performed on it. This might
    #              be the quantity of an item added to basket
